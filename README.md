# Jetpack Compose and Coroutines Example Project

Welcome to the Jetpack Compose and Coroutines Example Project! This repository is a collection of sample code that demonstrates the usage of Jetpack Compose, a modern toolkit for building native Android UI, in combination with Coroutines for handling asynchronous tasks.

## Project Overview
Jetpack Compose revolutionizes Android UI development by providing a declarative and modern approach to building user interfaces. Coroutines, on the other hand, offer a way to manage asynchronous operations efficiently. This project aims to showcase the seamless integration of these technologies in building robust and responsive Android applications.

## Screenshots

Here are some screenshots of the app in action:

### English Version:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <!-- Adjust the width attribute as needed to control the size -->
  <img src="img_3.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="300" style="margin-right: 10px;" />
  <img src="img.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="300" />
</div>

### Traditional Chinese Version:
<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
  <!-- Adjust the width attribute as needed to control the size -->
  <img src="img_2.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="300" style="margin-right: 10px;" />
  <img src="img_1.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="300" />
</div>

## Getting Started
